# Browser Testing Plan for Utuado: Sustainable Future

This document outlines the testing plan to ensure the Minecraft-style version of Utuado: Sustainable Future works properly across different browsers.

## Testing Environments

### Desktop Browsers
- Google Chrome (latest)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Microsoft Edge (latest)
- Opera (latest)

### Mobile Browsers
- Chrome for Android
- Safari for iOS
- Samsung Internet

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Performance Testing
- **Initial Load Time**: Measure time from navigation to interactive game
- **Frame Rate**: Monitor FPS during gameplay (target: 30+ FPS)
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption over time
- **CPU Usage**: Ensure CPU usage remains reasonable

### 2. Functionality Testing
- **Game Initialization**: Verify game loads correctly
- **Controls**: Test all input methods (mouse, keyboard, touch)
- **Building Placement**: Verify buildings can be placed and removed
- **Resource Management**: Check resource calculations and updates
- **Season System**: Verify season changes and effects
- **Event System**: Test event triggering and choices
- **UI Components**: Verify all UI elements function correctly

### 3. Compatibility Testing
- **Resolution Testing**: Test on various screen sizes and resolutions
- **Responsive Design**: Verify UI adapts to different screen sizes
- **WebGL Support**: Check for WebGL compatibility issues
- **Feature Detection**: Verify fallbacks work when features aren't supported

### 4. User Experience Testing
- **Control Responsiveness**: Ensure controls feel responsive
- **Visual Clarity**: Verify game elements are clearly visible
- **Text Readability**: Ensure all text is readable
- **Touch Target Size**: Verify touch targets are appropriately sized on mobile

## Test Cases

### Core Functionality
1. Game loads successfully and displays start screen
2. Player can navigate the 3D environment
3. Player can place buildings
4. Player can remove buildings
5. Resources update correctly over time
6. Seasons change as expected
7. Events trigger and choices have appropriate effects
8. Game state persists during play session

### UI Components
1. Resource display shows correct values
2. Season indicator updates correctly
3. Building menu opens and closes
4. Building selection works
5. Help panel displays correctly
6. Event dialog displays and handles choices
7. Notifications appear and disappear as expected

### Performance Scenarios
1. Initial world generation
2. Placing multiple buildings in quick succession
3. Running game for extended period (10+ minutes)
4. Handling multiple events in sequence
5. Rapid camera movement/rotation

## Testing Process

1. **Setup Testing Environment**:
   - Create test build of the game
   - Prepare testing devices and browsers
   - Set up performance monitoring tools

2. **Execute Test Cases**:
   - Run through all test cases on each browser/device
   - Document any issues encountered
   - Capture screenshots/recordings of issues

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Measure and record performance metrics
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Compare performance across browsers

4. **Issue Prioritization**:
   - Categorize issues by severity
   - Prioritize fixes based on impact and frequency
   - Identify browser-specific issues

5. **Optimization and Fixes**:
   - Implement fixes for identified issues
   - Optimize problematic areas
   - Retest to verify fixes

## Expected Results

- Game should maintain 30+ FPS on modern browsers
- All functionality should work consistently across browsers
- UI should be usable on both desktop and mobile devices
- No critical functionality should be broken on any supported browser
- Minor visual differences between browsers are acceptable

## Reporting

Test results will be documented in a browser compatibility report that includes:
- Summary of findings
- Browser-specific issues
- Performance metrics
- Recommendations for optimization
- Screenshots of any visual discrepancies

This testing plan will ensure the Minecraft-style version of Utuado: Sustainable Future provides a consistent and functional experience across all major browsers.
