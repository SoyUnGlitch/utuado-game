# Optimized Minecraft-Style Utuado Game Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for creating an optimized Minecraft-style version of the Utuado game that will run smoothly across all browsers. Based on user feedback that the previous Three.js implementation froze at the start screen with non-functional controls, this plan focuses on performance optimization and cross-browser compatibility.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Rendering Engine
- Use Three.js with simplified voxel rendering techniques
- Implement chunking system to only render visible areas
- Use instanced mesh rendering for identical blocks
- Implement frustum culling to avoid rendering off-screen elements
- Use low-poly block models with simple textures

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Merge geometry of static blocks to reduce draw calls
- Implement level-of-detail (LOD) system for distant objects
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Optimize raycasting for block selection
- Minimize JavaScript garbage collection triggers
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Implement throttling for non-critical updates

### 3. Memory Management
- Implement efficient data structures for block storage
- Use typed arrays for position and color data
- Implement chunk loading/unloading based on player position
- Minimize texture sizes and use texture atlases

### 4. Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Use WebGL 1.0 features for maximum compatibility
- Implement fallbacks for unsupported features
- Test on multiple browsers and devices
- Avoid browser-specific APIs
- Use feature detection instead of browser detection

## Game Features

### 1. Core Gameplay
- Resource management (energy, water, food, materials)
- Building placement and interaction
- Simplified AI integration visualization
- Environmental challenges
- Character interactions

### 2. User Interface
- Minimalist HUD showing essential resources
- Simple building menu with categories
- Clear visual feedback for interactions
- Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices
- Keyboard shortcuts for desktop users

### 3. World Design
- Simplified terrain representing Utuado's landscape
- Distinct block types for different resources and buildings
- Color-coding for different building functions
- Recognizable character models

### 4. Interaction System
- Click/tap to place blocks
- Shift+click/long press to remove blocks
- Simple camera controls (pan, zoom, rotate)
- Context-sensitive actions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Engine Setup
1. Set up basic Three.js environment
2. Implement optimized voxel rendering system
3. Create chunk management system
4. Implement basic camera controls
5. Set up raycasting for block interaction

### Phase 2: Game Mechanics
1. Implement resource management system
2. Create building placement system
3. Develop simplified AI integration visualization
4. Implement seasonal cycle effects
5. Create basic character interaction system

### Phase 3: User Interface
1. Design and implement minimalist HUD
2. Create building menu system
3. Implement feedback systems for user actions
4. Develop tutorial elements
5. Create game state management

### Phase 4: Content and Polish
1. Create block types and textures
2. Design and implement terrain generation
3. Create character models
4. Implement sound effects
5. Add visual effects for environmental conditions

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
1. Test on multiple browsers and devices
2. Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
3. Optimize for low-end devices
4. Ensure all game features function correctly
5. Implement final performance optimizations

## Technical Requirements
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Simple asset loading system
- Efficient data structures for voxel storage
- Cross-browser compatible code
- Touch and mouse input handling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Deployment Strategy
1. Create a clean, optimized build
2. Host on Vercel as a static site
3. Implement cache headers for faster loading
4. Use content delivery network (CDN) for assets
5. Provide clear instructions for users

This plan addresses the user's feedback by creating a Minecraft-style game with simplified graphics that will run smoothly across all browsers while maintaining the core gameplay elements of the original Utuado concept.
